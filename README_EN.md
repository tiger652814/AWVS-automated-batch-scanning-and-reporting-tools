# AWVS Automated Batch Scanning and Reporting Tool

The AWVS Automated Batch Scanning and Reporting Tool is a Python-based application designed to provide security researchers using AWVS (Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner) with automated scanning and report generation capabilities. This tool is particularly suitable for scenarios that require security assessments of multiple targets, significantly improving work efficiency through automation.

## Project Introduction

This project is an exploratory attempt to experiment with the potential of deep learning models in automating code generation. Through this project, we aim to showcase the application prospects of artificial intelligence in software development, especially in enhancing development efficiency and promoting innovative thinking.

Currently, the code in the project has been manually fine-tuned to ensure its practicality and effectiveness. We encourage community members to get involved, make suggestions, and jointly push the development of the project.

## Project Background

The development background of this project is quite dramatic, originating from a series of sarcasms between a client and our company. In this process, both parties exhibited resistance to artificial intelligence and automated programs. However, it was this seemingly unfavorable environment that inspired our determination to explore the application of AI in software development.

We believe that through practice and exploration, we can better understand the potential and limitations of AI technology, thereby guiding its healthy development. Therefore, despite facing skepticism and resistance from the outside world, we are committed to advancing our exploration.
